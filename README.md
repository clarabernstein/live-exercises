# ADSP Interview Exercises

This repository contains the exercises for the ADSP interview process.

## Exercises
- [ml-debugging](ml-debugging/README.md)

## Your Task
- Create a fork of the ADSP repository
- Clone the fork to your local machine
- Complete the exercises and commit your solutions
- Create a Pull Request from your fork back into ADSP respository

After you have completed the exercises there will be a discussion of your approach and solutions with the ADSP team, so unless specified there's no requirement to make comments within your code, but you may do so if you find this useful.

The Pull Request does not need a detailed description.

## Rules
### You may use Google
Some of these exercises require you to fix buggy code. Day to day our Data Scientists and Data Engineers use Google to help research
bugs and error messages.

### You must not use code generation tools
These tasks are an opportunity for you to show off your coding skills. We want to see how you approach problems and how you write code, so
we ask that:

- you don't use ChatGPT or similar tools to generate code
- you don't use GitHub Copilot or similar tools to generate code

In practice at ADSP, we do make use of these tools to speed up our development process.
