# Machine Learning Debugging

## Introduction

This directory contains the Python source code, requirements, and data files, for training and evaluating a machine learning model using scikit learn.

The `./src` directory contains the Python code and data files, and the `./requirements.txt` file contains the Python dependencies.

## Task
Using your preferred Python environment isolation mechanism, install the dependencies listed in `./requirements.txt`.

The `./src` directory contains a file called `exercise.py`, which trains a machine learning model for evaluation against a test dataset.

This file contains a number of bugs, and the CSV files may contain data quality issues which prevent the model from being trained and evaluated successfully.

Your task is to:
- correct bugs if the fixes are quick to implement
- if the fixes are not quick to implement, document how you would fix them / note what issues you have identified
- run the trained model against `test.csv` data if possible, if not document what changes would be required to do so

NB: You may recognise the dataset used in this exercise. You should use the versions of the data provided in this repository, rather than downloading from another source.
